            We guarantee accurate descriptions and high-quality products as
            mentioned on our website. To protect customers from shipping damage,
            item mismatch, or missing parts, we provide a 2-day window (from the
            date of order delivery) to report any complaints. You can go to the
            "My Account" section, select your order, and request a refund. Our
            technical team will verify the details, and if approved, issue an
            RMA number for returning the material. Upon receiving the product,
            our experts will verify the reported issue and send replacement
            items with shipping costs prepaid by us. If replacement is not
            possible due to stock unavailability, we will issue a 100% refund.
            Please note that the warranty does not apply if the product has been
            misused, subjected to neglect, accident, modification, or altered in
            any way.
